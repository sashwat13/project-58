       <p>My favourite hobby was to play boardgames like SCRABBLE but during this Pandemic,Now I love to read books.I like to read Fun-Filled Mystery Books like the Find-Outers series by Enid Blyton and Funny Comics like Tinkle.I like to read these books in my leisure time if I have any.</p>
<p> Now I have understood that books are little friends of people which not only help in passing time but also "OPEN A VOCABULARY BANK" for us. It gives us knowledge to us about many new words and makes one discipline as well.</p>
<p id="p1"> People usually are lazy to read books but reading books is one of the best hobby one can develop.</p>
